In this case we're\nusing a single float value as a uniform to control the opacity of the triangle.\nIn this case we can use the CPU to calculate what the fade should be based on\nthe time as we increment the value. And on each frame before every draw call,\nwe update the value of the uniform. The GPU will then remember that as a fixed\nvalue until we update it again, which happens to be on each frame.</p>\n<p>As far as opacity goes, this example doesn't exactly work. I'm not sure why the\nexample shows the console under the triangle each time. So I think there could\nbe some setting that I'm missing when setting up the OpenGL context.</p>"}]},"allTutorialsJson":{"nodes":[{"lessons":[{"index":0,"title":"Introduction"},{"index":1,"title":"Blue Triangle"},{"index":2,"title":"Red Square"},{"index":3,"title":"Green Circle"},{"index":4,"title":"Fragment Shader"},{"index":5,"title":"Multiple Shapes"},{"index":6,"title":"Fade in and Out"},{"index":7,"title":"Transform Triangle"},{"index":8,"title":"Draw a Cube"},{"index":9,"title":"Textured Cube"},{"index":10,"title":"Render Model"}]}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"egl-model","index":6}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
