The original intention was\nto try and introduce the concepts of fragment shaders and show how rules can\nbe written in the shader to describe what color a given primitive is. The\nproblem is that this is kind of a stupid example. But I think I'll leave it\nin anyways. Maybe I can get some feedback on how to improve it and what can\nbe demonstrated with fragments or how to describe it.</p>"}]},"allTutorialsJson":{"nodes":[{"lessons":[{"index":0,"title":"Introduction"},{"index":1,"title":"Blue Triangle"},{"index":2,"title":"Red Square"},{"index":3,"title":"Green Circle"},{"index":4,"title":"Fragment Shader"},{"index":5,"title":"Multiple Shapes"},{"index":6,"title":"Fade in and Out"},{"index":7,"title":"Transform Triangle"},{"index":8,"title":"Draw a Cube"},{"index":9,"title":"Textured Cube"},{"index":10,"title":"Render Model"}]}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"egl-model","index":4}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
