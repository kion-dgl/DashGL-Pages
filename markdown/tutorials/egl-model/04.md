# Color

So this is an example that didn't really go well. The original intention was
to try and introduce the concepts of fragment shaders and show how rules can
be written in the shader to describe what color a given primitive is. The 
problem is that this is kind of a stupid example. But I think I'll leave it
in anyways. Maybe I can get some feedback on how to improve it and what can
be demonstrated with fragments or how to describe it.
